SUPPORT & TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

COMMON ISSUES:

Issue: Menu links not showing
  Cause: timetable_settings.is_enabled = 0
  Solution: Enable via Company Admin toggle
  Verification: SELECT is_enabled FROM timetable_settings WHERE school_id = 1

Issue: API returns 401 Unauthorized
  Cause: User not logged in or wrong role
  Solution: Login as correct user type (admin or staff)
  Verification: Check session['user_id'] and session['user_type']

Issue: Swap request blocked
  Cause: Department permission restriction
  Solution: Check department permissions
  Query: SELECT * FROM timetable_department_permissions 
         WHERE department = 'CS' AND school_id = 1

Issue: Period not appearing
  Cause: Period not created or wrong school_id
  Solution: Verify period created for correct school
  Query: SELECT * FROM timetable_periods WHERE school_id = 1

Issue: JavaScript errors in browser console
  Cause: API endpoint not found or 404 error
  Solution: Verify blueprint registered, check route
  Test: curl http://localhost:5000/api/timetable/periods

DEBUG COMMANDS:

Check if system enabled:
  SELECT * FROM timetable_settings WHERE school_id = 1;

List all periods:
  SELECT * FROM timetable_periods WHERE school_id = 1 ORDER BY period_number;

View department permissions:
  SELECT * FROM timetable_department_permissions WHERE school_id = 1;

Check staff assignments:
  SELECT * FROM timetable_assignments 
  WHERE school_id = 1 AND staff_id = 5
  ORDER BY day_of_week, period_number;

View pending swaps:
  SELECT * FROM timetable_alteration_requests 
  WHERE school_id = 1 AND status = 'pending';

Check self-allocations:
  SELECT * FROM timetable_self_allocations 
  WHERE school_id = 1 ORDER BY day_of_week, period_number;

GETTING HELP:

For technical issues:
  1. Check Python logs for errors
  2. Check browser console (F12 → Console)
  3. Test API with curl/Postman
  4. Verify database schema
  5. Review implementation guide

For feature requests:
  1. Document requirements clearly
  2. Provide use case examples
  3. Create mockups if UI change
  4. Assign priority level
